# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON data in Express.js applications. The problem involves the server failing to parse JSON data correctly from client requests, resulting in an empty request body.

## Bug Description
The provided Express.js server endpoint is designed to receive JSON data. However, due to a missing or improperly configured middleware, the server fails to correctly parse the incoming JSON, resulting in an empty `req.body`. This prevents the application from accessing the intended data.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the correct middleware (`express.json()`) is included and properly positioned in the middleware stack. This middleware parses the incoming request body and makes it available as `req.body`.  The middleware must be placed *before* any route handlers that expect JSON data.
